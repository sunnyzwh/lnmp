.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
\&\fBmemslap\fR is a load generation and benchmark tool for \fImemcached\fR\|(1)
servers. It generates configurable workload such as threads, concurrencies, connections,
run time, overwrite, miss rate, key size, value size, get/set proportion,
expected throughput, and so on. Furthermore, it also supports data
verification, expire-time verification, \s-1UDP\s0, binary protocol, facebook test,
replication test, multi-get and reconnection, etc.
.PP
Memslap manages network connections like memcached with
libevent. Each thread of memslap is bound with a \s-1CPU\s0 core, all
the threads don't communicate with each other, and there are several socket
connections in each thread. Each connection keeps key size distribution,
value size distribution, and command distribution by itself.
.PP
You can specify servers via the \fB\-\-servers\fR option or via the
environment variable \f(CW\*(C`MEMCACHED_SERVERS\*(C'\fR.

.SH "DETAILS"
.IX Header "DETAILS"
.SS "Effective implementation of network."
.IX Subsection "Effective implementation of network."
For memslap, both \s-1TCP\s0 and \s-1UDP\s0 use non-blocking network \s-1IO\s0. All
the network events are managed by libevent as memcached. The network module
of memslap is similar to memcached. Libevent can ensure
memslap can handle network very efficiently.
.SS "Effective implementation of multi-threads and concurrency"
.IX Subsection "Effective implementation of multi-threads and concurrency"
Memslap has the similar implementation of multi-threads to
memcached. Memslap creates one or more self-governed threads;
each thread is bound with one \s-1CPU\s0 core if the system supports setting \s-1CPU\s0
core affinity.
.PP
In addition, each thread has a libevent to manage the events of the network;
each thread has one or more self-governed concurrencies; and each
concurrency has one or more socket connections. All the concurrencies dona\*^XXt
communicate with each other even though they are in the same thread.
.PP
Memslap can create thousands of socket connections, and each
concurrency has tens of socket connections. Each concurrency randomly or
sequentially selects one socket connection from its socket connection pool
to run, so memslap can ensure each concurrency handles one
socket connection at any given time. Users can specify the number of
concurrency and socket connections of each concurrency according to their
expected workload.
.SS "Effective implementation of generating key and value"
.IX Subsection "Effective implementation of generating key and value"
In order to improve time efficiency and space efficiency, 
memslap creates a random characters table with 10M characters. All the
suffixes of keys and values are generated from this random characters table.
.PP
Memslap uses the offset in the character table and the length
of the string to identify a string. It can save much memory.
Each key contains two parts, a prefix and a suffix. The prefix is an
uint64_t, 8 bytes. In order to verify the data set before, 
memslap need to ensure each key is unique, so it uses the prefix to identify
a key. The prefix cannot include illegal characters, such as a\*^XX\era\*^XX, a\*^XX\ena\*^XX,
a\*^XX\e0a\*^XX and a\*^XX a\*^XX. And memslap has an algorithm to ensure that.
.PP
Memslap doesna\*^XXt generate all the objects (key-value pairs) at
the beginning. It only generates enough objects to fill the task window
(default 10K objects) of each concurrency. Each object has the following
basic information, key prefix, key suffix offset in the character table, key
length, value offset in the character table, and value length.
.PP
In the work process, each concurrency sequentially or randomly selects an
object from the window to do set operation or get operation. At the same
time, each concurrency kicks objects out of its window and adds new object
into it.
.SS "Simple but useful task scheduling"
.IX Subsection "Simple but useful task scheduling"
Memslap uses libevent to schedule all the concurrencies of
threads, and each concurrency schedules tasks based on the local task
window. Memslap assumes that if each concurrency keeps the same
key distribution, value distribution and commands distribution, from
outside, memslap keeps all the distribution as a whole. 
Each task window includes a lot of objects, each object stores its basic
information, such as key, value, expire time, and so on. At any time, all
the objects in the window keep the same and fixed key and value
distribution. If an object is overwritten, the value of the object will be
updated. Memslap verifies the data or expire-time according to
the object information stored in the task window.
.PP
Libevent selects which concurrency to handle based on a specific network
event. Then the concurrency selects which command (get or set) to operate
based on the command distribution. If it needs to kick out an old object and
add a new object, in order to keep the same key and value distribution, the
new object must have the same key length and value length.
.PP
If memcached server has two cache layers (memory and \s-1SSD\s0), running
memslap with different window sizes can get different cache
miss rates. If memslap adds enough objects into the windows at
the beginning, and the cache of memcached cannot store all the objects
initialized, then memslap will get some objects from the second
cache layer. It causes the first cache layer to miss. So the user can
specify the window size to get the expected miss rate of the first cache
layer.
.SS "Useful implementation of multi-servers , \s-1UDP\s0, \s-1TCP\s0, multi-get and binary protocol"
.IX Subsection "Useful implementation of multi-servers , UDP, TCP, multi-get and binary protocol"
Because each thread is self-governed, memslap can assign
different threads to handle different memcached servers. This is just one of
the ways in which memslap supports multiple servers. The only
limitation is that the number of servers cannot be greater than the number
of threads. The other way to support multiple servers is for replication
test. Each concurrency has one socket connection to each memcached server.
For the implementation, memslap can set some objects to one
memcached server, and get these objects from the other servers.
.PP
By default, Memslap does single get. If the user specifies
multi-get option, memslap will collect enough get commands and
pack and send the commands together.
.PP
Memslap supports both the \s-1ASCII\s0 protocol and binary protocol,
but it runs on the \s-1ASCII\s0 protocol by default. 
Memslap by default runs on the \s-1TCP\s0 protocol, but it also
supports \s-1UDP\s0. Because \s-1UDP\s0 is unreliable, dropped packages and out-of-order
packages may occur. Memslap creates a memory buffer to handle
these problems. Memslap tries to read all the response data of
one command from the server and reorders the response data. If some packages
get lost, the waiting timeout mechanism can ensure half-baked packages will
be discarded and the next command will be sent.

.SS "Key size, value size and command distribution."
.IX Subsection "Key size, value size and command distribution."
All the distributions are read from the configuration file specified by user
with a\*^XXa\*^XXcfg_cmda\*^XX option. If the user does not specify a configuration file,
memslap will run with the default distribution (key size = 64,
value size = 1024, get/set = 9:1). For information on how to edit the
configuration file, refer to the a\*^XXConfiguration Filea\*^XX section.
.PP
The minimum key size is 16 bytes; the maximum key size is 250 bytes. The
precision of proportion is 0.001. The proportion of distribution will be
rounded to 3 decimal places.
.PP
The minimum value size is 1 bytes; the maximum value size is 1M bytes. The
precision of proportion is 0.001. The proportion of distribution will be
rounded to 3 decimal places.
Currently, memslap only supports set and get commands. And it
supports 100% set and 100% get. For 100% get, it will preset some objects to
the server.
.SS "Multi-thread and concurrency"
.IX Subsection "Multi-thread and concurrency"
The high performance of memslap benefits from the special
schedule of thread and concurrency. Ita\*^XXs important to specify the proper
number of them. The default number of threads is 1; the default number of
concurrency is 16. The user can use a\*^XXa\*^XXthreadsa\*^XX and a\*^XX\*(--concurrencya\*^XX to
specify these variables.
.PP
If the system supports setting \s-1CPU\s0 affinity and the number of threads
specified by the user is greater than 1, memslap will try to
bind each thread to a different \s-1CPU\s0 core. So if you want to get the best
performance memslap, it is better to specify the number of
thread equal to the number of \s-1CPU\s0 cores. The number of threads specified by
the user can also be less or greater than the number of \s-1CPU\s0 cores. Because
of the limitation of implementation, the number of concurrencies could be
the multiple of the number of threads.
.PP
1. For 8 \s-1CPU\s0 cores system
.PP
For example:
.PP
\&\-\-threads=2 \-\-concurrency=128
.PP
\&\-\-threads=8 \-\-concurrency=128
.PP
\&\-\-threads=8 \-\-concurrency=256
.PP
\&\-\-threads=12 \-\-concurrency=144
.PP
2. For 16 \s-1CPU\s0 cores system
.PP
For example:
.PP
\&\-\-threads=8 \-\-concurrency=128
.PP
\&\-\-threads=16 \-\-concurrency=256
.PP
\&\-\-threads=16 \-\-concurrency=512
.PP
\&\-\-threads=24 \-\-concurrency=288
.PP
The memslap performs very well, when
used to test the performance of memcached servers.
Most of the time, the bottleneck is the network or
the server. If for some reason the user wants to
limit the performance of memslap, there
are two ways to do this:
.PP
Decrease the number of threads and concurrencies.
Use the option a\*^XX\*(--tpsa\*^XX that memslap
provides to limit the throughput. This option allows
the user to get the expected throughput. For
example, assume that the maximum throughput is 50
kops/s for a specific configuration, you can specify
the throughput equal to or less than the maximum
throughput using a\*^XX\*(--tpsa\*^XX option.
.SS "Window size"
.IX Subsection "Window size"
Most of the time, the user does not need to specify the window size. The
default window size is 10k. For Schooner Memcached, the user can specify
different window sizes to get different cache miss rates based on the test
case. Memslap supports cache miss rate between 0% and 100%.
If you use this utility to test the performance of Schooner Memcached, you
can specify a proper window size to get the expected cache miss rate. The
formula for calculating window size is as follows:
.PP
Assume that the key size is 128 bytes, and the value size is 2048 bytes, and
concurrency=128.
.PP
1. Small cache cache_size=1M, 100% cache miss (all data get from \s-1SSD\s0).
win_size=10k
.PP
2. cache_size=4G
.PP
(1). cache miss rate 0%
.PP
win_size=8k
.PP
(2). cache miss rate 5%
.PP
win_size=11k
.PP
3. cache_size=16G
.PP
(1). cache miss rate 0%
.PP
win_size=32k
.PP
(2). cache miss
.PP
rate 5%
.PP
win_size=46k
.PP
The formula for calculating window size for cache miss rate 0%:
.PP
cache_size / concurrency / (key_size + value_size) * 0.5
.PP
The formula for calculating window size for cache miss rate 5%:
.PP
cache_size / concurrency / (key_size + value_size) * 0.7
.SS "Verification"
.IX Subsection "Verification"
Memslap supports both data verification and expire-time
verification. The user can use \*(L"\-\-verify=\*(R" or \*(L"\-v\*(R" to specify the proportion
of data verification. In theory, it supports 100% data verification. The
user can use \*(L"\-\-exp_verify=\*(R" or \*(L"\-e\*(R" to specify the proportion of
expire-time verification. In theory, it supports 100% expire-time
verification. Specify the \*(L"\-\-verbose\*(R" options to get more detailed error
information.
.PP
For example: \-\-exp_verify=0.01 a\*^XXverify=0.1 , it means that 1% of the objects 
set with expire-time, 10% of the objects gotten will be verified. If the
objects are gotten, memslap will verify the expire-time and
value.
.SS "multi-servers and multi-clients"
.IX Subsection "multi-servers and multi-clients"
Memslap supports multi-servers based on self-governed thread.
There is a limitation that the number of servers cannot be greater than the
number of threads. Memslap assigns one thread to handle one
server at least. The user can use the \*(L"\-\-servers=\*(R" or \*(L"\-s\*(R" option to specify
multi-servers.
.PP
For example:
.PP
\&\-\-servers=10.1.1.1:11211,10.1.1.2:11212,10.1.1.3:11213 \-\-threads=6 \-\-concurrency=36
.PP
The above command means that there are 6 threads, with each thread having 6
concurrencies and that threads 0 and 3 handle server 0 (10.1.1.1); threads 1
and 4 handle server 1 (10.1.1.2); and thread 2 and 5 handle server 2
(10.1.1.3).
.PP
All the threads and concurrencies in memslap are self-governed.
.PP
So is memslap. The user can start up several 
memslap instances. The user can run memslap on different client
machines to communicate with the same memcached server at the same. It is
recommended that the user start different memslap on different
machines using the same configuration.
.SS "Run with execute number mode or time mode"
.IX Subsection "Run with execute number mode or time mode"
The default memslap runs with time mode. The default run time
is 10 minutes. If it times out, memslap will exit. Do not
specify both execute number mode and time mode at the same time; just
specify one instead.
.PP
For example:
.PP
\&\-\-time=30s (It means the test will run 30 seconds.)
.PP
\&\-\-execute_number=100000 (It means that after running 100000 commands, the test will exit.)
.SS "Dump statistic information periodically."
.IX Subsection "Dump statistic information periodically."
The user can use \*(L"\-\-stat_freq=\*(R" or \*(L"\-S\*(R" to specify the frequency.
.PP
For example:
.PP
\&\-\-stat_freq=20s
.PP
Memslap will dump the statistics of the commands (get and set) at the frequency of every 20
seconds.
.PP
For more information on the format of dumping statistic information, refer to a\*^XXFormat of Outputa\*^XX section.
.SS "Multi-get"
.IX Subsection "Multi-get"
The user can use \*(L"\-\-division=\*(R" or \*(L"\-d\*(R" to specify multi-get keys count.
Memslap by default does single get with \s-1TCP\s0. Memslap also supports data 
verification and expire-time verification for multi-get.
.PP
Memslap supports multi-get with both \s-1TCP\s0 and \s-1UDP\s0. Because of
the different implementation of the \s-1ASCII\s0 protocol and binary protocol,
there are some differences between the two. For the \s-1ASCII\s0 protocol,
memslap sends one a\*^XXmulti\-geta\*^XX to the server once. For the
binary protocol, memslap sends several single get commands
together as a\*^XXmulti\-geta\*^XX to the server.
.SS "\s-1UDP\s0 and \s-1TCP\s0"
.IX Subsection "UDP and TCP"
Memslap supports both \s-1UDP\s0 and \s-1TCP\s0. For \s-1TCP\s0,
memslap does not reconnect the memcached server if socket connections are
lost. If all the socket connections are lost or memcached server crashes,
memslap will exit. If the user specifies the a\*^XX\*(--reconnecta\*^XX
option when socket connections are lost, it will reconnect them.
.PP
User can use a\*^XX\*(--udpa\*^XX to enable the \s-1UDP\s0 feature, but \s-1UDP\s0 comes with some
limitations:
.PP
\&\s-1UDP\s0 cannot set data more than 1400 bytes.
.PP
\&\s-1UDP\s0 is not supported by the binary protocol because the binary protocol of
memcached does not support that.
.PP
\&\s-1UDP\s0 doesna\*^XXt support reconnection.
.SS "Facebook test"
.IX Subsection "Facebook test"
Set data with \s-1TCP\s0 and multi-get with \s-1UDP\s0. Specify the following options:
.PP
\&\*(L"\-\-facebook \-\-division=50\*(R"
.PP
If you want to create thousands of \s-1TCP\s0 connections, specify the
.PP
\&\*(L"\-\-conn_sock=\*(R" option.
.PP
For example: \-\-facebook \-\-division=50 \-\-conn_sock=200
.PP
The above command means that memslap will do facebook test,
each concurrency has 200 socket \s-1TCP\s0 connections and one \s-1UDP\s0 socket.
.PP
Memslap sets objects with the \s-1TCP\s0 socket, and multi-gets 50
objects once with the \s-1UDP\s0 socket.
.PP
If you specify \*(L"\-\-division=50\*(R", the key size must be less that 25 bytes
because the \s-1UDP\s0 packet size is 1400 bytes.
.SS "Replication test"
.IX Subsection "Replication test"
For replication test, the user must specify at least two memcached servers.
The user can use a\*^XXa\*^XXrep_write=a\*^XX option to enable feature.
.PP
For example:
.PP
\&\-\-servers=10.1.1.1:11211,10.1.1.2:11212 a\*^XXrep_write=2
.PP
The above command means that there are 2 replication memcached servers,
memslap will set objects to both server 0 and server 1, get
objects which are set to server 0 before from server 1, and also get objects
which are set to server 1 before from server 0. If server 0 crashes,
memslap will only get objects from server 1. If server 0 comes
back to life again, memslap will reconnect server 0. If both
server 0 and server 1 crash, memslap will exit.
.SS "Supports thousands of \s-1TCP\s0 connections"
.IX Subsection "Supports thousands of TCP connections"
Start memslap with \*(L"\-\-conn_sock=\*(R" or \*(L"\-n\*(R" to enable this
feature. Make sure that your system can support opening thousands of files
and creating thousands of sockets. However, this feature does not support
reconnection if sockets disconnect.
.PP
For example:
.PP
\&\-\-threads=8 \-\-concurrency=128 \-\-conn_sock=128
.PP
The above command means that memslap starts up 8 threads, each
thread has 16 concurrencies, each concurrency has 128 \s-1TCP\s0 socket
connections, and the total number of \s-1TCP\s0 socket connections is 128 * 128 =
16384.
.SS "Supports binary protocol"
.IX Subsection "Supports binary protocol"
Start memslap with \*(L"\-\-binary\*(R" or \*(L"\-B\*(R" options to enable this
feature. It supports all the above features except \s-1UDP\s0, because the latest
memcached 1.3.3 does not implement binary \s-1UDP\s0 protocol.
.PP
For example:
.PP
\&\-\-binary
.PP
Since memcached 1.3.3 doesn't implement binary \s-1UDP\s0 protocol,
memslap does not support \s-1UDP\s0. In addition, memcached 1.3.3 does not support
multi-get. If you specify \*(L"\-\-division=50\*(R" option, it just sends 50 get
commands together as a\*^XXmulit\-geta\*^XX to the server.
.SH "Configuration file"
.IX Header "Configuration file"

when no configuration file is specified memslap reads the default
